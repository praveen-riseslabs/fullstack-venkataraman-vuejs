Backend:

The backend technology used for this project Spring Boot.

This backend involved with spring security for user registration and user login.

For every sucessful login it generates token and with that token we can access data from server side.

I defined two roles USER and ADMIN currently not using them but just defined.

Also implemented Forgot password section successfully sending the link to mail to reset password and working the fuctioning properly.


Frontend:

The frontend technology used for this project vue3.

Implemented registration form logic and login logic in frontend.

It sends the user object Json for registration of user and login of user.

The sent file validated by the backend.
