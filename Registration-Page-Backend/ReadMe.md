This is Back end project for Registration and login for a user. In this project I used Spring boot 3.2 as back end technology and mysql as database.

# Prerequisites:

__Before you begin, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your Windows machine.__
__Before you begin, ensure you have MYSQL database work bench__

# Installation Steps:

__Download STS:__

Visit the official Spring Tool Suite download page: [STS](https://spring.io/tools)  Installing Spring boot is the same as installing any other software.

Choose platform as you like for mine I choosen Spring tools 4 for Eclipse (Windows).

Click on the "Download STS" button. Choose the appropriate version based on your Windows architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

##### Run the Installer:

Once the download completes, locate the downloaded STS installer file (usually in the Downloads folder).

Double-click the installer file to start the installation process.

Select Installation Directory:

The installer will prompt you to choose the installation directory for STS.

Select a preferred directory or use the default one suggested by the installer.

##### Installation Progress:

The installer will begin copying files and configuring the STS environment.

Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a few minutes depending on your system's performance.

##### Launch STS:

Once the installation finishes, you'll have the option to launch STS immediately after installation.

If not automatically launched, locate the STS executable file in the installation directory and double-click it to open the Spring Tool Suite.

##### Configure STS:

Upon launching STS for the first time, you might be prompted to select a workspace directory.

Choose a workspace directory where your projects will be stored, or stick with the default workspace provided by STS.

##### Start Using STS:

After configuring the workspace, STS will open with the welcome screen.

You are now ready to start creating and managing your Spring projects using the Spring Tool Suite on your Windows machine.

### Troubleshooting:

##### Java JDK Not Found:

If STS fails to start due to Java JDK not found, ensure that JDK is installed and the environment variable JAVA_HOME is correctly set.
